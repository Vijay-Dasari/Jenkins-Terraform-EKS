Problem Description:

Terraform Command Not Found: When running a Jenkins pipeline that includes Terraform commands, the error terraform: command not found was encountered.
Environment Variable Configuration: The PATH environment variable in the Jenkins pipeline did not include the directory where Terraform was installed.
Symbolic Link Confusion: The initial path provided for Terraform was a symbolic link, which was broken or incorrectly set.



Summary of the Solution:
Locate the Terraform Executable: Use find to locate the actual path of the Terraform executable.
Verify Permissions: Ensure the Jenkins user has execute permissions for the Terraform executable.
Configure Jenkins:
Update the Terraform installation path in Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.
Set the PATH environment variable in the Jenkins pipeline to include the Terraform installation directory.
Restart Jenkins: Restart Jenkins to apply configuration changes.
Verify: Run the pipeline to ensure Terraform commands are executed without errors.
